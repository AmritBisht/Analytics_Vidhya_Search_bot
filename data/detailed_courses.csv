This course teaches you the latest developments in Natural Language Processing like BERT, Transformers using PyTorch. ",4 Hours,4.6/5,Intermediate,No trainer available,"
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the hottest field in the data science space right now. The demand for NLP experts and data scientists is through the roof.
We have seen a remarkable rise in the amount of research and breakthroughs in NLP recently. We can trace this recent rise to one (seismic) paper – “Attention is All You Need” by Google AI. This breakthrough has spawned so many new and exciting NLP libraries that enable us to work with text in ways that were previously limited to our imagination (or Hollywood).
These NLP deep learning developments have spawned some mind-boggling applications. We’re sure you’ve already interacted with and used some of them yourself:

Human-level chatbots (dialogue systems like Google Duplex and Meena)
Text generation (Machines writing text from scrtach, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2 model)


Here’s a quick list of the latest Natural Language Processing concepts in deep learning every NLP expert and even enthusiast should know:

Language Modeling
Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling
Attention Mechanism
Transformer Architecture
Transfer Learning in NLP, and much more!


These are key NLP deep learning concepts you should master if you want to successfully navigate through the NLP goldmine.

This is a very common question interviewers ask in data science interviews. We have conducted hundreds of these interviews for both data analyst and data scientist roles and this is quite often the jackpot question. This is especially true if you’re a fresher or a relative newcomer to data science.
Just doing courses or attaining certifications isn’t good enough. Almost everyone we know holds certifications in various aspects of data science. It adds no value to your resume if you don’t combine it with practical experience.
And that’s where open-source data science projects play such a key role!

Ever heard of version control? It is one of the most important concepts in a data scientist’s daily role - and yet most newcomers and beginners haven’t even come across it! This is a fallacy you must overcome as soon as possible.
You need to understand how to navigate through Git and GitHub if you want to make it as a data science professional. While a lot of folks know about these tools (having used them for cloning open source code from Google Research and other top data science organizations), they never really understand their real purpose.
The beauty of version control will be akin to a revelation. The way you can create a remote project and have all your team members work on different features parallelly yet independently but still have a stable running code at the end of the day - priceless! A lot of the problem we face in data science while working remotely and independently will be erased with a quick understanding of Git and GitHub.
Yes, this course really is that important!

What is a Decision Tree?
A Decision Tree is a flowchart like structure, where each node represents a decision, each branch represents an outcome of the decision, and each terminal node provides a prediction / label.

Why learn about Decision Trees?

Decision Trees are the most widely and commonly used machine learning algorithms.
Decision Trees can be used for solving both classification as well as regression problems.
Decision Trees are robust to Outliers, so if you have Outliers in your data - you can still build Decision Tree models without worrying about impact of Outliers on your model.
Decision Trees are easy to interpret and hence have multiple applications in different industries.

What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a technique used to analyse the emotion in a text. We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it. 
In the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.


What are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?

In the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about 
a movie you liked or 
a book you didn’t like or 
a product you bought was not up to the mark.


Therefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer’s opinion.
It is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.

 
On what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?
There are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:

Sentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.
Analyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.

For other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/

What is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?

In the earlier days of Natural language processing and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.
However, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.
This has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing 


Can I add this project to my resume and use it in my Interview?

Sentiment Analysis is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning and Classification in Natural language processing
We also encourage you to take up more diverse datasets and apply sentiment analysis on them.
Sentiment Analysis is also one of the first projects you would learn in your Natural language processing journey and as such is commonly asked in interviews.

Evaluation metrics form the backbone of improving your machine learning model. Without these evaluation metrics, we would be lost in a sea of machine learning model scores - unable to understand which model is performing well.
¬†
Wondering where evaluation metrics fit in? Here‚Äôs how the typical machine learning model building process works:

We build a machine learning model (both regression and classification included)
Get feedback from the evaluation metric(s)
Make improvements to the model
Use the evaluation metric to gauge the model‚Äôs performance, and
Continue until you achieve a desirable accuracy

¬†
Evaluation metrics, essentially, explain the performance of a machine learning model. An important aspect of evaluation metrics is their capability to discriminate among model results.

Due to their popularity, a lot of data science aspirants even end up thinking that they are the only forms of regression! Or at least linear regression and logistic regression are the most important among all forms of regression analysis.
¬†
The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between. There are multiple types of regression apart from linear regression:

Ridge regression
Lasso regression
Polynomial regression
Stepwise regression, among others.

¬†
Linear regression is just one part of the regression analysis umbrella. Each regression form has its own importance and a specific condition where they are best suited to apply.

The need and importance of extracting data from the web is becoming increasingly loud and clear. There is an unprecedented volume of data on the internet right now - and data science projects often need this data to build predictive models.
That’s a key reason why data scientists are expected to be familiar with web scraping.
We have found web scraping to be a very helpful technique for gathering data from multiple websites. Some websites these days also provide APIs for many different types of data you might want to use, such as Tweets or LinkedIn posts.
But there might be occasions when you need to collect data from a website that does not provide a specific API. This is where having the ability to perform web scraping comes in handy. As a data scientist, you can code a simple Python script and extract the data you’re looking for.
So knowing how to perform web scraping using Python will help you go a long way towards becoming a resourceful data scientist. Are you ready to take the next step and dive in?
A note of caution here – web scraping is subject to a lot of guidelines and rules. Not every website allows the user to scrape content so there are certain legal restrictions at play. Always ensure you read the website’s terms and conditions on web scraping before you attempt to do it.
In this course, we will dive into the basics of web scraping using Python. We will understand what web scraping is, the different Python libraries for performing web scraping, and finally we’ll implement web scraping using Python in a real-world project. There’s a lot to unpack here so enroll today and start learning!

Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organisation of data. For all the data science and machine learning enthusiasts it is paramount to be well versed with various statistical concepts such as Hypothesis testing
Every day we find ourselves testing new ideas, finding the fastest route to the office, the quickest way to finish our work, or simply finding a better way to do something we love. The critical question, then, is whether our idea is significantly better than what we tried previously.
These ideas that we come up with on such a regular basis – that’s essentially what a hypothesis is. And testing these ideas to figure out which one works and which one is best left behind, is called hypothesis testing.
